Aim of this project is to implement chip8 interpreter and have some fun while doing it. 

I had two goals from the very start 
* write the interpreter in a way that would allow for easy use with different front ends
* make it run on Windows/Linux OS

Sometimes I am using this project for testing of some ideas/technologies I would like to use/learn.
